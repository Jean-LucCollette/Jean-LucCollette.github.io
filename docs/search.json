March Madness refers to the annual NCAA college basketball tournament which typically happens in March. With “March Madness” being a popular event that attracts the excitement of sports fans, and can potentially line the pockets of many gamblers, it serves as an interesting exercise to analyze the performance of the different teams who participate. We are compiling a dataset of both the conference performance and individual school performance.\nIn order to do this, we used the rvest and polite package in order to scrape the contents of the site and build our dataset. Before scraping however, we verified using the paths_allowed function to check the robots.txt which gave permission for scraping. We created functions in order to scrape the site over multiple years in order to gain a broader understanding of how performance has changed over time. Our analysis may provide insights into what teams may be standout picks based on previous performance and may highlight strengths and weaknesses that lie in a team alongside variables that affect their performance. We could also analyse what conferences have historically been the best and what that may mean with many conferences changing in recent years.\n\nIndividual School Performance\n\n# check that scraping is allowed\nrobotstxt::paths_allowed(\"https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/seasons/men/1993-advanced-school-stats.html\")\n\n\n www.sports-reference.com                      \n\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n# Step 1: Download the HTML and turn it into an XML file with read_html()\nbasketball_site &lt;- read_html(\"https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/seasons/men/1993-advanced-school-stats.html\")\n\n\n#Main function to create list\nbasketball_stats &lt;- function(year_list) {\n  \n basketball_stats_data_list &lt;- purrr::map(year_list, ~ basketball_scrape(year = .x) %&gt;% mutate(year = .x))\n \nbasketball_stats_all_years &lt;- list_rbind(basketball_stats_data_list)\n\nreturn(basketball_stats_all_years)\n\n}\n\n\n#Smaller function to grab data \n\nbasketball_scrape &lt;- function(year) {\n  \n  session &lt;- bow(str_c(\"https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/seasons/\", year,\"-advanced-school-stats.html\"), force = TRUE)\n  \ntitle_temp &lt;- html_nodes(basketball_site, css = \"table\") #Look for tables\n\n#The table of interest is the first one so we use [[1]]\nBasketball_table &lt;- html_table(title_temp, header = T, fill = T)[[1]] %&gt;%  row_to_names(row_number = 1) %&gt;% \n  clean_names() %&gt;%  \n  select(-c(starts_with(\"na\"))) #the table has na cols so we clean names then drop those cols\n\nreturn(Basketball_table)\n}\n\ntest&lt;- basketball_scrape(\"2000\") # test data for the smaller function\n\nWarning: Row 1 does not provide unique names.

Throughout our extended stays in each country, our study will be guided by questions like the following: When studying abroad, how can we learn from or with other people and places in the world in an ethical, non-exploitative way? How can service be an ethical part of study abroad? What ethical issues are present in teaching abroad contexts?\n\n\nEnvironmental Sustainability in Costa Rica\nThis course will use the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals as a critical lens for examining sustainable development in tropical regions, using the case study of Costa Rica—a country renowned for its leadership in land protection, reforestation, high educational attainment, and progress toward gender and racial equality. Costa Rica has been a global leader in conserving its lands/water systems and is emerging as a leader in addressing how to ensure sustainable development and management systems. This program will immerse you in efforts to create a green, circular, and sustainable economy in Costa Rica.\n\n\nPolitical and Social Change in Southern Africa: Namibia\nThis course examines the legacy of colonialism and apartheid in Southern Africa. The course will review the political history of Southern Africa with a particular focus on South Africa and Namibia as countries who have endured years of racial segregation under the apartheid system. It will highlight the social and political movements that have evolved in the struggle for independence.\n\n\nEconomic Reform and Development in Vietnam\nThis course charts Vietnam’s transition from a centrally planned to a market-oriented economy and the associated socio-political changes as well as environmental costs. Students examine in detail the major turning point in Vietnam’s economic development the Doi Moi “Renovation” economic reforms launched in 1986 – and the rapid growth in trade and investment since that time. The course additionally examines development ethics and equity issues within the context of the country’s growing market economy and the urban consumer class."

    "section": "My Blog Post",
    "text": "My Blog Post\nHere is the blog post I wrote for my main assignment during global semester. This was during our excursion in Swakopmund, Namibia\n\n\n\nSand Sign in Namibia\n\n\nHello, welcome to the blog. This week was busy, so if you don’t have time, here’s a TL;DR: We heard from several speakers on the historical context of Namibia, including the Namibian Genocide, drove around Walvis Bay and Swakopmund with lots of sand dunes, and met wild seals face-to-face. There was lots to talk about this week!\nOn Wednesday we started with a tour of the Namibian Parliament building. Parliament here is similar to the U.S. in that two bodies determine the laws: the National Assembly and National Council. The assembly is the main lawmaking body, while the council reviews laws and sends back recommendations of what to fix, which the assembly doesn’t even have to listen to. Parliament here strongly focuses on youth politics, with the youngest member presiding and many other related organizations like the National Youth Council.\n\n\n\nNamibian Flag at Parliament\n\n\nIn the afternoon, we started learning about the Namibian Genocide with a documentary and a discussion with Dr. Elison Tjirera. Most of us had never even heard about the events that occurred here and were shocked at what atrocities occurred. The German army and leadership were focused on expansion in the early 1900s and would do anything to claim more land. They forced the local Nama and OvaHerero tribes into a desert and kept them starving without food or water. Later, they made concentration camps for the people that remained. We also discussed how Swakopmund is now a “little Germany,” which I’ll discuss later in the blog.\nBefore we headed to Swakopmund, we had two more speakers- JP Van de Westhuizen and Shane from the Namibian Ministry of Environment, Forestry, and Tourism. We learned from JP that the core of the genocide was the need for land, reiterating what we heard in the documentary. Today, land is split very unequally in Namibia. About half of the land in Namibia is privately owned, and of that half, 70% is owned by white people. This problem isn’t being fixed soon as the leading party, SWAPO, is very slow at land resolution, having only 25 completed resolutions out of 176 needed over the last 6 years.\nAs for hunting, it gave us a new understanding of game hunting in terms of a sustainable way of doing it. Namibia has systems of expensive permits with many years of training to legally hunt big game like elephants. Poaching does occur, which is hard for patrollers as they cover over a million hectares of land with only 14 guards patrolling.\n\nSwakopmund\n\n\n\nDrive to Swakopmund\n\n\nThe next day we headed to Swakopmund! Finally, a place without 5,000+ feet of elevation. I’ve never appreciated oxygen-rich air and the ocean breeze as much.\nWe enjoyed lunch by the coast, climbed some rocks, and made seagull sounds before we heard from our next guest speaker and tour guide, Laidlaw Peringanda, with a historical tour of Swakopmund.\n\n\n\nSwakopmund Coast\n\n\nAfter watching the documentary earlier in the week, I imagined a city from the far past with old monuments symbolizing oppression and powerful regimes. In Swakopmund, they were standing right in the center of the town. We saw monuments to the dead German soldiers during the genocide, German statues commemorating the soldiers that died during WW1 and WW2, and heard about stores that sold Third Reich merchandise down the street.\nNext, we went to the Swakopmund cemetery, which scared me about how different the graves of the Nama and OvaHerero tribes were treated to those of the Germans. You can see in the pictures below that the German graves are surrounded by lush greenery, fancy engravings, and a sign that translates to “They gave their lives for you.” The graves here are looked after by the local council and cleaned often.\n\n\n\nGerman Grave Site in Swakopmund\n\n\nOn the other side (in the same cemetery not even 200 feet away), you see the Nama & OvaHerero Genocide monuments with sand mounds in the background. These mounds are the mostly beheaded remains of those killed in concentration camps from hunger, intense labor, and more at the hands of German soldiers. Bodies were beheaded so that the Germans could study skull anatomy differences. The Lenz Company’s concentration camp alone (yes, companies owned labor camps for free labor) reported over 1300 deaths due to physical exhaustion.\n\n\n\nOvaHerero Grave\n\n\nThese graves are unkept by authorities, leaving relatives and volunteers to restore the graves every 4 months just to avoid body parts surfacing from the sands. Many of these volunteers get nightmares and trauma from this service. Additionally, the sign of the monument was only changed in 2020 (4 years ago!!!) to change the cause of mass death from “mysterious circumstances” to dying of starvation, labor, sexual abuse, disease, fatigue, and adverse weather conditions.\nEven worse, the government doesn’t care. Housing developments have encroached on the cemetery. During remembrance services for the genocide, local officials were seen going back to German graves to pay their respects. Even street sign changes that removed the names of old important German people have been branded on buildings to maintain the names in the community. It simply is an issue around little international pressure to pay reparations or recognize the atrocities they committed since it is merely Germany vs Namibia. As Dr. Tjirera put it earlier, the Germans don’t believe their lives are meaningful enough to care.\nOn Saturday, we headed to Walvis Bay to talk with a member of the Municipal Council about housing and development issues within the town. He stressed that Namibia had little to export and had to import most of its resources, with Walvis Bay being the country’s main port city. Housing development resources were scarce, leaving many people without homes. We saw this with metal shacks built in backyards homeowners use as “guesthouses” that people rent for decades.\nHe also discussed the development issue surrounding large malls taking business from the central business district. As an economics major going into a commercial real estate field, it was interesting to connect my experience in a place without U.S. laws to how life is for people without large apartments or tall developments. Apartments here form around a central “resource” building, with small homes surrounding it.\nAfter a long few days of learning, we had to end it with some fun outdoor activities that took up the rest of the weekend. We got to climb Dune 7, look out over several sand dunes into the ocean, and recreate the dune movies, making Paul our new Paul Atreides. We had to climb up the entire dune using our hands and feet, making every part of our body sore. It was all worth it at the top with several amazing photos and the chance to jump and run back down the dune.\n\n\n\nDune Buggies\n\n\nWe also got to go dune buggying back in Swakopmund! We got our own dune buggies and followed in a line cruising over and around the dunes. We all got to go super fast and feel the wind rush by us as sand hit our visors.\nSunday was the best day yet. When we first got to Namibia, we were surprised with a kayaking trip with Catamaran Cruises, but we didn’t know about the seal and pelican tour that came with it!\n\n\n\nPelican\n\n\nFrom the moment we started, seals were climbing on the dock and coming inches away from all of us. They were scary initially, but we learned they just wanted the fish the guides fed them. Some of us even got to feed the seals and got attacked by pelicans.\n\n\n\nSeals on the boat\n\n\nWhen we got to the other side of the bay, we started kayaking. Paul and I were a great duo, beating almost every pair of Globies in races (Fiona and Eva won every time).\nAfter that, we enjoyed a great lunch on the bay, and a small group of us went camel riding. Most of us had never ridden horses before, so we didn’t know any technique when riding them (it hurt a lot). Luckily, Fiona helped us with some technique since she did some horse-riding before.\n\n\n\nThe group kayaking\n\n\nThanks for reading! We’ve been on global for so long and still have so much left to learn and do, but it feels like it is going by so fast. It’s good since we are all enjoying ourselves, but I hope our second half doesn’t go by too fast.\nYahya chouhada,\nJean-Luc"

Not having your employer pay for Health insurance means that you must get health insurance yourself, potentially having to pay much more than you would if the employer included it in benefits.\nNumeric - Graph of % of people in Poverty - Interactive\n\n# Making percent_poverty permanent and rounding\npoverty_data &lt;- poverty_data |&gt;\n  mutate(percent_poverty = (poverty_2023/pop_2023)*100) |&gt;\n  mutate(percent_poverty = round(percent_poverty, digits = 2))\n\n# Creating category bins and assigning color palette\nbins &lt;- c(5, 7.5, 10.0, 12.5, 15.0, 17.5, Inf)\npal &lt;- colorBin(\"YlOrRd\", domain = poverty_data$percent_poverty, bins = bins)\n\n# Creating labels on hover\nlibrary(htmltools)\nlibrary(glue)\n\n# Modifying Labels to look good\npoverty_data &lt;- poverty_data |&gt;\n  mutate(state = str_to_title(state)) |&gt;\n  mutate(labels = str_c(state, \n                        \": \", \n                        percent_poverty, \n                        \"% of people are in Poverty\")) \n\n# creating a labels variable\nlabels &lt;- lapply(poverty_data$labels, HTML)\n\n\n# Interactive Graph\nleaflet(states) |&gt;\n  setView(-96, 37.8, 4) |&gt;\n  addTiles() |&gt;\n  addPolygons(\n    fillColor = ~pal(poverty_data$percent_poverty),\n    weight = 1,\n    opacity = 5,\n    color = \"white\",\n    dashArray = \"1\",\n    fillOpacity = 0.7,\n    highlightOptions = highlightOptions(\n      weight = 1,\n      color = \"#555\",\n      dashArray = \"\",\n      fillOpacity = 0.7,\n      bringToFront = TRUE),\n    label = labels,\n    labelOptions = labelOptions(\n      style = list(\"font-weight\" = \"normal\", padding = \"2px 2px\"),\n      textsize = \"10px\",\n      direction = \"auto\")) |&gt;\n  addLegend(pal = pal, values = ~poverty_data$percent_poverty, opacity = 0.7, title = \"% of People in Poverty\",\n    position = \"bottomright\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a graph of the Contiguous United States which is filled with color based on the % of people in poverty by state. The states range from under 7.5% of people in poverty to over 17.5% of people in poverty. Light yellow colors indicate a lower % in poverty while darker red colors indicate a higher percent of people in poverty. There is a trend that particularly south and southeastern states have higher rates of poverty than the rest of the United States with Louisiana and Mississippi being the highest. States in the northeast like New Hampshire and some across the midwest/west from Minnesota to Utah have lower poverty levels.\nCategorical - Above/below 50% of people have Employer Health Insurance\n\nEmployer_Insurance_data &lt;- read_csv(\"Datastat272Miniproject1poverty2.csv\")\nEmployer_Insurance_data\n\n# A tibble: 48 × 14\n   state  poverty_2023 children_poverty_2023 pop_1990 pop_2000 pop_2010 pop_2020\n   &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Alaba…       780043                236320  4040389  4447207  4780118  5024294\n 2 Arizo…       917925                246285  3665339  5130247  6392292  7157902\n 3 Arkan…       459700                140145  2350624  2673293  2916029  3011490\n 4 Calif…      4597732               1242302 29811427 33871653 37254522 39538212\n 5 Color…       538673                129751  3294473  4302086  5029319  5773707\n 6 Conne…       359550                 92619  3287116  3405650  3574151  3605912\n 7 Delaw…       109203                 32159   666168   783559   897947   989946\n 8 Flori…      2741486                689967 12938071 15982571 18804589 21538216\n 9 Georg…      1477354                469680  6478149  8186653  9688737 10713771\n10 Idaho        193938                 52105  1006734  1293957  1567658  1839117\n# ℹ 38 more rows\n# ℹ 7 more variables: pop_2023 &lt;dbl&gt;, Employer &lt;dbl&gt;, Above50_Employer &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   Medicaid &lt;dbl&gt;, Medicare &lt;dbl&gt;, Military &lt;dbl&gt;, Uninsured &lt;dbl&gt;\n\nEmployer_Insurance_data &lt;- Employer_Insurance_data |&gt;\n  mutate(state = str_to_lower(state))\n\n# Creating color palette for categoricals\npal &lt;- colorFactor(c(\"red\", \"yellow\"),\n  domain = Employer_Insurance_data$Above50_Employer)\n\n# Creating labels on hover\nEmployer_Insurance_data &lt;- Employer_Insurance_data |&gt;\n  mutate(state = str_to_title(state)) |&gt;\n  mutate(labels = str_c(state, \n                        \": \", \n                        Employer*100,\n                        \"% of people have Employer Insurance\")) \n\n# creating a labels variable\nlabels &lt;- lapply(Employer_Insurance_data$labels, HTML)\n\n\n# Interactive Graph\nleaflet(states) |&gt;\n  setView(-96, 37.8, 4) |&gt;\n  addTiles() |&gt;\n  addPolygons(\n    fillColor = ~pal(Employer_Insurance_data$Above50_Employer),\n    weight = 2,\n    opacity = 1,\n    color = \"white\",\n    dashArray = \"1\",\n    fillOpacity = 0.7,\n    highlightOptions = highlightOptions(\n      weight = 1,\n      color = \"#555\",\n      dashArray = \"\",\n      fillOpacity = 0.7,\n      bringToFront = TRUE),\n    label = labels,\n    labelOptions = labelOptions(\n      style = list(\"font-weight\" = \"normal\", padding = \"3px 8px\"),\n      textsize = \"15px\",\n      direction = \"auto\")) |&gt;\n  addLegend(pal = pal, values = ~Employer_Insurance_data$Above50_Employer, opacity = 0.7, title = \"Greater than 50% Employer Insurance\",\n    position = \"bottomright\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a graph of the Contiguous United States filled in based on if the states have greater or less than 50% of people who have Employer Health Insurance. A red color means that states have less than 50% of people with Employer Health Insurance while yellow represents states with greater than 50%. Again, we see that southern states particularly have low rates of Employer health Insurance while states in the midwest/west (Minnesota to Utah) and northeastern (New hampshire, Massachussets) regions have greater than 50% of people with Employer Health Insurance. For many people, having employers cover health insurance means that they will have to spend less out of their own pocket and time figuring out what insurance to get. This leads to people having less money overall and potentially going into poverty based on healthcare costs."
